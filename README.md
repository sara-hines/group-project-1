# BreweryBuzz: Denver Metro Brews and Events

Welcome to Metro Brewery and Concert-Hop, your ultimate companion for exploring breweries and events near you!

## Description

BreweryBuzz is the premier app for beer and music enthusiasts who want to discover, explore, and indulge in the world of craft beer and the Denver Metro area's live music scene. Skip the expensive drink tab at the concert. Visit a nearby brewery before or after the show! Whether you're a seasoned beer connoisseur or just starting your journey into the world of craft brewing, BreweryBuzz has everything you need to elevate your beer experience. And whether your idea of a great concert is Enrique Iglesias at Ball Arena in Denver, or folksy indie artist Sarah Jarosz at Englewood's intimate Gothic Theatre, we've got you covered with a wide variety of concerts generating buzz near you! 

To help you discover breweries, we incorporate a vast and ever-growing database of breweries from [Open Brewery DB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/) in order to provide you with the most up-to-date information on breweries near you. Open Brewery DB is a quality, community-driven, open source brewery dataset created by software engineer Chris J. Mears and maintained with the help of community contributors. The focus is on smaller, community-based breweries, cideries, brewpubs, and bottleshops which are open to the public. So, the breweries you will find when searching with BreweryBuzz will tend to be small, with plenty of nanobreweries (very small breweries which only distribute locally), brewpubs (restaurant/brewery combinations), proprietor breweries, and brewery incubators among the results. Visiting breweries you find through BreweryBuzz helps you to uncover hidden gems and must-visit spots run attentively by passionate local brewers. At the same time, you will be supporting small businesses and helping your craft beer community to thrive!

To connect you with concerts and events in your area, we use the [Ticketmaster Discovery API](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/products-and-docs/apis/discovery-api/v2/). This API sources events from various platforms, including Ticketmaster, Universe, FrontGate Tickets and Ticketmaster Resale (TMR). So, we're pulling from a large dataset to find the most accurate information on events in the Denver Metro area. For each event for the city of your search, we provide the event name, venue, date and time, and link to learn more and purchase tickets. Events are sorted by date from soonest to furthest out in the future, helping you to easily identify events you're interested in. BreweryBuzz searches for music-related events—most event results are concerts, but you will find some swing dancing and line dancing as well. You'll find bands and venues with a wide variety of personalities. At Mercury Cafe in Denver, you're as likely to run into poetry slams and tarot readings as jazz jams. Gothic Theatre in Englewood hosts plenty of noisy, hard, punk-y acts, but also dreamy indie pop artists if you're in the mood for something softer. 

Brewery Buzz provides more information on featured music venues and brewery types within the app. Feel free to browse and learn more about the Denver Metro area's craft brewery and live music offerings!

## Features 

When navigating to the site, you will be greeted by the search page with the following appearance: 

![screenshot1](https://github.com/sara-hines/work-day-planner/assets/90005274/e4e4d8b4-f745-4090-8ab3-b9670de550e7)

To search for breweries, select a city from the drop-down under "Search for Breweries." To search for events, select a city from the drop-down under "Search for Events." If you're not interested in events, feel free to only select a city to search for breweries, and vice versa. The below images show the appearance of the application when selecting a city to search for breweries, and when selecting a city to search for events, respectively. 

![screenshot2](https://github.com/sara-hines/work-day-planner/assets/90005274/763512f1-8ae7-46c3-931b-5c1b391cb6c5)

![screenshot3](https://github.com/sara-hines/work-day-planner/assets/90005274/f7420fd6-fb3a-41ee-8a66-07391ce0b1c1)

When you've made your selections of cities, simply click the "See Breweries and Events" button to see breweries and events.

As an example, when searching for breweries and events in Denver, a table of Breweries will be displayed (including the name of each brewery, the brewery type, address, and website), and a table of events will also be displayed (with the event name, venue, date & time, and website stated). The two images below show a sample of these results. 

![screenshot4](https://github.com/sara-hines/work-day-planner/assets/90005274/da4bfe90-05a7-4a92-9dfa-fdbd558d120e)

![screenshot5](https://github.com/sara-hines/work-day-planner/assets/90005274/224b4313-4b2c-446f-9980-342b2da5afbc)

If plans change and you decide you'd like to find a brewery in Arvada and events in Englewood, for example, just adjust the search cities in the drop-downs and click the "See Breweries and Events" button again. Searching for breweries in Arvada and events in Englewood will generate results similar to the below:

![screenshot6](https://github.com/sara-hines/work-day-planner/assets/90005274/ef558e44-ea53-475f-8cfe-1b0e8b4c2c0a)

![screenshot7](https://github.com/sara-hines/work-day-planner/assets/90005274/6e64e8f7-9047-4775-9166-d302172a2179)

![screenshot8](https://github.com/sara-hines/work-day-planner/assets/90005274/8ea9ed6c-333f-4547-97ef-d4eade4d99b7)

If you would like to learn more about the types of breweries BreweryBuzz features, click the "Learn more about brewery types" link beneath the drop-down to select a city for the brewery search. A modal explanation box (see the below image) will appear with descriptions of the brewery types you may come across in your exploration. 

![screenshot9](https://github.com/sara-hines/work-day-planner/assets/90005274/40a8ca59-a22a-4cee-b2dc-78db159dcca9)

To help you narrow your search of concerts and events by the venue, if desired, feel free to click the "Learn more about Concert and Event Venues" link beneath the drop-down for the event search. BreweryBuzz's modal tool will appear, describing some of the most prominent and/or unique venues in each Denver Metro city covered by our app. The modal has a scroll-bar, so you can dive in and explore these venues as deep as you like.

![screenshot10](https://github.com/sara-hines/work-day-planner/assets/90005274/0a67e84a-69b9-4440-bb19-57b61895758a)

To exit either modal, there are three options for flexibility: click the grey "x" button in the upper right hand corner of the white card displaying the information; click the greyed out background area around the white card; or click the white "x" in the upper right hand corner of your screen. 

Throughout the app, there are several transitions and hover effects to help guide user interaction and engage the eye. The below GIF displays the hover effect on the "See Breweries and Events" button.

![hover1](https://github.com/sara-hines/work-day-planner/assets/90005274/389fc58f-a428-492a-8d4c-5eeb999c2db6)

The "Learn more about brewery types" and "Learn more about Concert and Event Venues" have a hover effect applied as well, causing the text to change from the default burnt sienna color to black. View this effect in the GIF below: 

![linkhover1](https://github.com/sara-hines/work-day-planner/assets/90005274/6dfcec6f-906a-45d6-b45e-8f36f5cfe63f)

Most elements on the page are interactive in some way, and an animation effect causes the page elements to fade in gradually when first navigating to the page. 

## Development in Progress and Directions for Further Development 

A feature in progress will allow the user to "favorite" breweries and events, save them for future reference, and pull up favorited items later at the click of a button. This would help provide an easy way to remember breweries you enjoyed and would like to visit again, and/or bands and venues you'd like to explore further. 

Currently, a black outline of a star appears to the left of each brewery and event under the "Favorited" column, so that breweries and events start as unfavorited by default. After clicking the star outline, it changes to a solid blue star to signal that the item is now favorited. If the blue star is clicked again, it will change back to the star outline to signal that the item has been unfavorited. The GIF below shows this effect in action. 

![star1](https://github.com/sara-hines/work-day-planner/assets/90005274/707d84e0-52f9-4382-8205-2d85b9995ddb)

When the entire feature is completed, the appearance of the star will cause the brewery or event to actually be stored as a favorited item (or changed back to unfavorited and removed from storage). When the user clicks a button to see their favorited items, the favorited items will be displayed to the page. 

Additional features we would love to add: 
* Functionality to sort events/concerts by music genre and venue
* Displaying and sorting by hours of operation for each brewery—Open Brewery DB does not have this data, but perhaps another API would 
* Providing additional cities to search for events—Ticketmaster Discovery API pulls from many sources, but seems to focus on larger cities and does not have data for some Denver Metro cities we'd like to include. Potentially another API would have more data for smaller cities around Denver.
